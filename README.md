## Application Overview
Small Goals Health is an application for people who want to make improvements to their fitness and nutrition, but may have difficulty motivating themselves to follow a fitness plan and track their progress. 

This application will allow them to set a weekly goal for fitness, and track their actual effort towards that goal. They can also check whether they are meeting basic recommeded fruit and vegetable requirements for nutrition. 

Users may set their weekly goals as high or low as they feel on a new week. The goal of the program is motivation to make a change and make some daily effort. 
## Statement of Purpose
The purpose of this application is to help users to set a fitness goal for the week by assigning a minimum daily target to three chosen exercises at the start of the week. It also aims to encourage healthier eating.

On Monday the application will prompt the user to choose three exercises from a list. They will then set a target for each exercise that is achievable. 

For each day, the application will prompt the user to enter the achieved score for each exercise. For example, 15 reps of pushups or 40 minutes walking. The application will also ask if the user met the daily recommended intake of 2 serves of fruit and 5 serves of vegetables (yes/no). Responses will be saves to a file for review at the end of the week.

The problem which the application hopes to solve is that many people want to get healthier but struggle to motivate themselves to do regular exercise or eat better. Small Goals Health will help them by encouraging them to set small goals for each week that they will not mind trying. In a busy week, they might choose to set goals they can quickly achieve each day. When they feel they have more time or energy in a week, the goals may be bigger.
